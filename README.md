# Visualising Optimisation Data

This is the COMP3000 Computing Project on the topic of creating "A Web Platform for Visualising Optimisation Data".

**Project Supervisor**: _Dr. David Walker_

## Project Vision

This project aims to develop a “Web Platform for Visualising Optimisation Data”, for
evolutionary computation research at the University of Plymouth, to visualise aspects of optimisation data that is generated from evolutionary algorithms.

The web platform will provide:

- the ability for the optimisation data collected from client optimisers to be visualised in real-time,
- the playback of saved optimisation runs,
- a deployed web platform acting as a single tool which collects all appropriate visualisations for optimisation runs.
